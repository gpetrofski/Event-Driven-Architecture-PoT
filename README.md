# Event-Driven Architecture - Proof of Technology

Here, you will find the Labs around our Event-Driven Architecture Proof of Technology, using IBM Event Automation capabilities.
We will introduce you to different capabilities, including Event Streams, Event Endpoint Management and Event Processing.

The lab material has been created so that everyone can follow along to their own pace.

The instructors will make sure that the necessary environments have been provided and will provide you all access credentials and documentation needed to finish the labs.

## Requirements

The only requirements are a laptop with a modern browser (e.g. Chrome / Firefox).
All the lab materials will be provided through this Github repository.
The access credentials and URL's for accessing the different platforms, will be shared separately.
